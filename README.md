# Project 1 - What's For Dinner?

## Goal 
To combine restaurant finding and recipe finding into one web application.

## Usage
* Makes calls to server APIs: Yelp Fusion API and EDAMAM's Recipe Search API
* Checks for user inputs and set as API parameters
* Shows results based on user inputs

This project consists of the following files:

* index.html: Restaurant finder page and the landing page when it is first loaded
* recipeFinder.html: Recipe finder page
* script.js: Manage API calls to Yelp Fusion API and show results for index.html/Restaurant finder page
* script2.js: Manage API calls to EDAMAM's Recipe Search API and show results for recipeFinder.html
* style.css: General styling of index.html and recipeFinder.html

This project is made using HTML5, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, Bootstrap, Yelp Fusion API and EDAMAM's Recipe Search API

## Future Developments
* Add ability to search for multiple dietary restrictions, include others with access to full API
* UI - would eliminate whitespace
* Custom photography or high quality stock images, sized more proportionally inside cards
* More details in recipe window
* More results shown, load as you scroll
* Display current location when on click "Use my Current Location"
* More features - Patio Availability (important during a pandemic), links to order takeout & delivery through 3rd party service
* Add Maps API - directions to restaurant
* Add Meal Kits as a third option
